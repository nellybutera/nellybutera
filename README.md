  <p> I remember when I was little, I loved watching those movies where the protagonist was this computer geniusðŸ˜…, he didn't wear a cape but I always thought he had  super powers to do! And it seems i wasn't wrong, Quality software development skills in the hands of a developer are like a super powerâš¡ Only a few years ago I found out that you can make a computer do whatever you want it to. There's always a way! And when you find it, there could be any greater joy for a programmer.</p>
